# Network Security Scanner

The **Network Security Scanner** is a Python tool that scans a target host for open ports, identifies services running on those ports, and attempts to crack login credentials for SSH and FTP services using wordlists. It provides a comprehensive overview of a target systemâ€™s potential vulnerabilities by identifying accessible services and attempting basic brute-force attacks.

## Requirements

To run the **Network Security Scanner**, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

### Python Version

- Python 3.6 or higher (Tested on Python 3.11)

### Required Modules

- `argparse`: Standard Python library for parsing command-line arguments.
- `socket`: Standard Python library for networking interfaces.
- `sys`: Standard Python library for system-level operations.
- `datetime`: Standard Python library for handling dates and times.
- `paramiko`: SSH protocol handling (install with `pip install paramiko`).
- `ftplib`: Python's built-in FTP client library.
- `concurrent.futures`: Standard Python library for executing concurrent operations.
- `pwn`: A library for security research (install with `pip install pwntools`).

### Files Required

- `sshcred.txt`: A file containing SSH credentials in the format `username:password`.
- `ftpcred.txt`: A file containing FTP credentials in the format `username:password`.
- `top5000ports.txt`: A file listing common ports to scan when using the `--topPorts` option.

## Features

- **Port Scanning**: Scans individual ports, a range of ports, or the top 1000 most commonly used ports.
- **Service Detection**: Attempts to identify the service running on open ports.
- **Brute Force**: Uses wordlists to attempt cracking SSH and FTP credentials on open ports.
- **Colored Output**: Color-coded terminal output for enhanced readability.

## Usage

```bash
python3 network_scanner.py <target_host> [OPTIONS]
```

## Example Usage

### Basic Port Scanning

```bash
python3 network_scanner.py 192.168.1.1 -p 22-80
```
This scans ports 22 through 80 on the target machine.

### Full Port Scan

```bash
python3 network_scanner.py 192.168.1.1 -p-
```
This scans all ports on the target machine.

### Get Version Information

```bash
python3 network_scanner.py 192.168.1.1 -p 22-80 -v
```
This scans ports 22 through 80 and attempts to retrieve version information for services running on those ports.

### Running cracking Scripts
```bash
python3 network_scanner.py 192.168.1.1 -sc
```
This attempts to crack SSH and FTP credentials using the provided wordlists (sshcred.txt and ftpcred.txt).

### Example Output
```bash
[*] Scanning target: 192.168.1.1
